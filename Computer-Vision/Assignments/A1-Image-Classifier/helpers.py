# Helper functions

import os
import glob # library for loading images from a directory
import cv2

# This function loads in images and their labels and places them in a list
# The list contains all images and their associated labels
# For example, after data is loaded, im_list[0][:] will be the first image-label pair in the list

## Standardize the input images
# Resize each image to the desired input size: 600x1100px (hxw).
# This function should take in an RGB image and return a new, standardized version

# With each loaded image, we also specify the expected output. 
# For this, we use binary numerical values 0/1 = night/day.
# Examples: 
# encode("day") should return: 1
# encode("night") should return: 0
